# Chrome CORS Toggle Extension (clean version)

A clean version of the CORS toggle extension.

Got fed up by Chineese "developers" constantly publishing the same extension over and over again. Each and every version they publish is compromised - opens a websocket (or some other connection) to their servers and sends each URL you visit.

This one is a clean version of that extension and is guaranteed not to do any data collection.
